# Zets
This is a notes repository that acts as a general collection. The subjects of
each note are broken into a "card" like structure loosely based on the
[Zettlekasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).

I find that I also need a repository for structured notes that extend past the
arbitrary length limit for memory management, so this is intermingled with
general purpose long-form notes.

The tool I use to create these is [zet-cli](https://github.com/mattdood/zet-cli), which is
geared toward Linux users.
