# linkedlist intro
Arrays in general are versatile structural tools (uses the List ADT).

## Linked data structure
Rather than store data in contiguous memory, **linked data structures** store data
anywhere in memory. This connects by keeping a reference/pointer/relationship
between locations.

The linkedlist module covers the list ADT implementations for:
* singly-linked
* doubly-linked
* circularly-linked
