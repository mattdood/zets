# django rest framework api key rocks
Recently I started working on an application that requires a user to generate
API keys for themselves. I found that the out of box solutions within the
[Django REST Framework API Key](https://florimondmanca.github.io/djangorestframework-api-key/)
package were *fantastic*.

The documentation is incredible and I found it very easy to work this into
testing soutions.
