# insertion sort
Insertion sorts involve the creation of a sorted list by shifting items to the right
based on their size in relation to each item.

This has the same runtime as bubble sort.

## How it works
We have to iterate over the list to determine if any of the indexes need to have
their data pushed further in the list. We store a "current" variable that will hold
our item while iterating the array.

Copy all of the data until we determine an index that is smaller than the current
item we are shifting.

## Big-o
The insertion sort runs in very poor time, O(n^2). This is due to the best and worst
case scenarios both being O(n) for comparisons.


|    | Best | Worst |
|----|------|-------|
| passes | O(1) | O(n) |
| comparisons | O(n) | O(n) |
| total | O(n) | O(n^2) |
| | linear | quadratic |

## Example implementation
This implementation utilizes Python and is parametrized with Pytest.

```python
def insertion_sort(list: List[int]) -> List[int]:

    length = len(list)
    for i in range(length):
        current_item = list[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and list[j] > current_item:
            list[j + 1] = list[j]
            j -= 1
        list[j + 1] = current_item

    return list


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "list",
    [
        ([]),
        ([1]),
        ([1, 2]),
        ([2, 1]),
        ([7, 4, 9, 2]),
        ([8, 7, 4, 2, 1]),
    ],
)
def test_insertion_sort(list):
    list = insertion_sort(list)

    length = len(list)
    for i in range(length):
        for j in range(0, length-i-1):
            assert list[j] <= list[j + 1]
```
