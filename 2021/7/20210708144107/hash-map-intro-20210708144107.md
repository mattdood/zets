# hash map intro
Looking at hashmaps (hashtables) which are one of the most commonly used data structures
in computer science. Hashmaps are useful for searching for specific data in our
data structure.

The searched data is a **key** and the implemented ADT is the **Map ADT** with
the **Set ADT**.

## Hashing
Hashing has an average time complexity of O(1) for searching, with flexible techniques
being derived from it.
