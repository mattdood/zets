# bubble sort
Bubble sorting is when we take an unsorted array of objects and sort the array
in place. This does not allow us to do a new instantiation of an array, so we
utilize a temp variable for what is being worked on.

## How it works
We have to iterate the list and compare each of the items to the prior item to determine
if it needs to be moved. We have to go through each prior item to find the index
that needs to be swapped.

## Big-o
The bubble sort runs in very poor time, O(n^2). This is due to the best and worst
case scenarios both being O(n) for comparisons.


|    | Best | Worst |
|----|------|-------|
| passes | O(1) | O(n) |
| comparisons | O(n) | O(n) |
| total | O(n) | O(n^2) |
| | linear | quadratic |

## Sample implementation
This Python implementation includes Pytest tests that are parametrized.

```python

def bubble_sort(list: List[int]) -> List[int]:

    length = len(list)

    for i in range(length-1):
        for j in range(0, length-i-1):
            if list[j] > list[j+1]:
                temp = list[j]
                list[j] = list[j+1]
                list[j+1] = temp
    return list


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "list",
    [
        ([4, 5, 3, 7, 7]),
        ([8]),
        ([8, 7]),
        ([3, 5, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3]),
    ],
)
def test_bubble_sort(list):

    list = bubble_sort(list)

    length = len(list)
    for i in range(length-1):
        for j in range(0, length-i-1):
            assert list[j] <= list[j + 1]
```
