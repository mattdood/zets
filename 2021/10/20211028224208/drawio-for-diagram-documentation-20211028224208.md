# drawio for diagram documentation
Using [draw.io](https://draw.io) as visual aide in project planning, execution,
and general explanation has been a huge lifesaver the past several months.

I have found that the diagramming is straightforward, I don't have any missing
icons or functionality from Visio that I can't find on the site, and it truly
is just quick to pick up.

## Workflow
When using the site I tended to just use whatever workspace was cached and
add/remove pages as needed, then export to PNGs ad-hoc. As I've gotten used
to the site I now have a more refined workflow (spare the occasional ad-hoc
meeting where it helps to show something on the fly).

1. Create a repo to house everything
1. Add to the repo as needed in singular commits with the diagram(s) name in the commit
    1. I save these as a draw.io XML file to keep everything in order
1. Load from the repo 1 diagram at a time
