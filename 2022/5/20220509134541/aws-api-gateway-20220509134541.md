# aws api gateway
APIs are used to interact with web applications and apps use them to communicate
with each other.

1. Publish, maintain, monitor APIs - service to handle APIs at any scale
1. Front door - like a front door for applications to access data/logic/functions
from backend services (apps on EC2, lambda)
1. Supported API types:
    1. RESTful APIs - optimized for stateless, serverless workloads
    1. Websocket APIs - real time apps like chat applications

## RESTful APIs
* Representational State Transfer
* Optimized for serverless and web applications
* Stateless
* Supports JSON

## Advantages
* Allows you to connect to applications running on Lambda, EC2, beanstalk, etc.
* Send each API endpoint to a different target, if needed
* Supports multiple versions - allowing dev/staging/prod, etc.
* Serverless - cost effective and scalable
* CloudWatch - API Gateway logs API calls, latencies, error rates
* Throttling - helps manage throttling, DDOS attacks, etc.

## Exam tips
* Endpoint to apps running in AWS
* Like the front door to an application
* Serverless - cost effective and scales automatically
* Throttle API Gateway to prevent overloading
* CloudWatch logging for all calls, latencies, errors
