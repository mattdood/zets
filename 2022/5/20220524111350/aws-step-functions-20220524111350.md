# aws step functions
Step functions provide a visual interface for serverless applications,
enabling developers to build and run serverless applications as a series
of steps.

These are orchestrators for serverless applications. A step function allows us
to manage logic of the application, including:
* Sequencing
* Error handling
* Retry logic
* Logging of each execution step

## Building step functions
Step functions can be built using JSON objects or using the new AWS visual builder.
The visual builder allows users to create "workflows" that give flexibility in
passing data through interfaces, calling services, etc.
