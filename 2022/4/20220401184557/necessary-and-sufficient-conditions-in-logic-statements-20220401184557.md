# necessary and sufficient conditions in logic statements
Searching for precise definitions is employing the necessary and/or sufficient
conditions for the applications of a term, concept, or occurrence of a phenomenon or event.

It is important to determine if the conditions in the hypothesis are necessary/sufficient
to justify conclusion.

## Sufficient and necessary conditions
These help to identify the terms hypothesis and conclusion in a conditional statement.
The terms sufficient and necessary in English mean exactly what they mean in conditional logic.

If `p` and `q` denote statements then:
"`p` is a sufficient condition for `q`". Meaning that the occurrence of `p` suffices
to guarantee the occurrence of `q`.

"`p` is a necessary condition for `q`". meaning that the occurrence of `p` is necessary
to obtain the occurrence of `q`.

These are not equivalent to each other. They exist as converses of each other, meaning
`if p, then q` is equivalent to:
* `p` is a sufficient condition for `q`
* `q` is a necessary condition for `p`

**Note:** It is possible for one to be sufficient and another to be not necessary,
or both to be sufficient/necessary to each other, etc.

"`p` if and only if, `q`" is equivalent:
* `p` is a necessary and sufficient condition for `q`
* `q` is a sufficient and necessary condition for `p`

## Interpreting a sufficient condition

Statement to rewrite:
"For a function to be continuous, it is sufficient that it is differentiable"

**Note:** There are multiple ways to write this statement. Sufficient is not fixed
 in its position.

 * The truth of the condition "a function being differentiable" is *sufficient* to ensure
 the truth of the condition "the function being continuous"

 Equivalent form:
 "If a function is differentiable, then a function is continuous"

## Interpreting a necessary condition

Statement to rewrite:
"Doing homework regularly is a necessary condition for Jim to pass the course"

* The truth of the condition "Jim doe shomework regularly" is *necessary* for the
condition "Jim to pass the course" to be true

Equivalent form:
"If Jim passes the course, then he does the homework regularly"

Contrapositive form:
"If Jim doe snot do homework regularly, then he does not pass the course"

## Interpreting a sufficient and necessary condition

Statement to rewrite:
"Being a number divisible by 6 is a sufficient and necessary condition for it being
divisible by both 2 and 3"

* The truth of the condition "a number being divisible by 6" is *sufficient* to ensure
the truth of the condition "a number being divisible by both 2 and 3", and the truth of the
condition "a number being divisible by 6 is *necessary* for the truth
of the condition "a number being divisible by both 2 and 3"

Equivalent form:
"A number is divisible by 6 if, and only if, it is divisible by both 2 and 3"
