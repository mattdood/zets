# shorthand for domains in math
Domain shorthand can be tricky. This is a quick breakdown:

`D` = Domain (defined, like {1, 2, 3})
`N` = Natural numbers (all positive integers, starting at 1 to inf)
`Q` = Rational numbers (written as a ratio)
`R` = All real numbers, including all real numbers (i.e., [-inf, inf])
`Z` = Integers (all negative and positive [-inf, ..., 0, ..., inf])
