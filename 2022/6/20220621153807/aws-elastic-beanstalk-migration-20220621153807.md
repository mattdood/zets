# aws elastic beanstalk migration
Migrating existing applications to Elastic Beanstalk environments is managed using
a purposebuilt tool to do the migration.

For .NET migration the AWS team has created the `Windows Web Application Migration Assistant`,
formerly known as `.NET Migration Assistant`
    * This is an interactive PowerShell utility that lift-n-shift's the entire
    site to Elastic Beanstalk
