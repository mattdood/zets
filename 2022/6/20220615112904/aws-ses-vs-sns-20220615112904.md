# aws ses vs sns
Simple Email Service (SES) is a scalable and highly available email service.
Designed to help marketing teams and application developers send emails to customers
in a pay-as-you-go model.

## Features
* Send and receive email. Received emails are delivered to an S3 bucket.
* Trigger events via lambda or SNS notifications
* Scalable and highly available email - designed in pay-as-you-go for teams that
need to send mass amounts of emails

## Use cases
* Automated emails - notification emails, confirmations for purchases, etc.

## SNS vs. SES
* SES:
    * Email messaging service
    * Can trigger a lambda function or SNS notification
    * Can be used for incoming and outgoing email
    * An email adress is allt hat is required to start sending messages
* SNS:
    * Pub/sub messaging service; formats include SMS, HTTP, SQS, email
    * Can trigger a lambda function
    * Can fanout messages to a large number of recipients (replicate and push
    messages to multiple endpoints and formats)
        * Much more sophisticated solution than SES
    * Consumers must subscribe to a topci to receive the notifications

## Exam tips
* SES is for email only
* Send and receive emails - incoming/outgoing mail (saved to S3 for incoming)
* Not subscription-based - you only need to know the email address

* SNS is all about push notifications, not receiving
* SNS supports multiple formats
* SNS needs to have a subscription to a topic via a pub/sub model
* Fanout messages to a large number of recipients (multiple SQS queues,
HTTP endpoints, and email addresses)
