# aws kms api calls
API calls are used from within services like EC2 to set up KMS with a running
service.

Examples include setting up encrypt/decrypt, actually encrypting/decrypting
data (files), and re-encrypting decrypted data.

These are performed with the AWS CLI or AWS SDK and have support for automatically
rotating KMS keys annually.

## Exam tips (API calls)
* aws kms encrypt - encrypts plaintext into ciphertext using a CMK
* aws kms decrypt - decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted by an AWS KMS CMK
* aws kms re-encrypt - decrypts ciphertext and then re-encrypts it entirely within
AWS KMS (like when you change a CMK or manually rotate the CMK)
* aws kms enable-key-rotation - Enables automatic key rotation every 365 days
* aws kms generate-data-key - Uses the CMK to generate a data key to encrypt data >4KB
