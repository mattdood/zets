# aws intro to ci cd
Continuous integration, continuous delivery/deployment for applications enabling
small changes & automating everything. Creating small, incremental code changes
while having automations for code integration/build/test/deployment.

This is great because you can successfully apply thousands of changes per day.

## Benefits to CI/CD
* Automation - fast, repeatable, scalable, enabling rapid deployment
* Manual is bad - slow, error prone, inconsistent, unscalable, complex
* Small changes - test each code change and catch bugs while they're small and simple to fix

## CI workflow
* Shared code repository - multiple devs contributing to a shared code repository like Git
    * Frequently merging or integrating code updates
* Automated build - changes appearing int he code triggers an automated build of the new
code
* Automated testing - run automated tests to check the code locally before it is committed
into the master code repository

## CD workflow
* Code is merged - after successful tests the code is merged
* Prepared for deployment - code is built, tested, packaged for deployment
* Manual decision vs. fully automated - either a manual review and publish or a fully
automated deployment is done

## AWS developer tools
* CodeCommit - source and version control service enabling teams to colalborate on code,
html pages, scripts, images, and binaries
* CodeBuild - compiles source code, runs tests, and produces packages that are ready to deploy
* CodeDeploy - automates code deployment stot any instance, including EC2, Lambda, and on-premises
* CodePipeline - end-to-end solution, build, test, and deploy your application when code changes

## Exam tips
* CI - Remember CodeCommit
* CD - Remember CodeBuild and CodeDeploy
* Automation - Remember CodePipeline
* AWS wrote a whitepaper called `Practicing Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment on AWS`
    * Explains features and benefits of their services
