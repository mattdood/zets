# osi 7 layer model
Just a few quick notes on the OSI 7 layer model to keep myself from googling it later.

## General
The OSI 7 layer model is a conceptual framework to describe network functions.
This is used to model the flow of information in an application.

### Layers
Each distinct layer has distinct responsibilities as part of the whole.

1. Layer 7 application - end user side, HTTP and web browsers
1. Layer 6 presentation - data in a usable format. Handles encryption and SSH
1. Layer 5 session - maintains connections and sessions
1. Layer 4 transport - Transmits data using TCP/UDP
1. Layer 3 network - Logically routes packets based on IP address
1. Layer 2 data lint - physically transmits data based on MAC addresses
1. Layer 1 physical - transmits bits and bytes over physical devices
