# changing ownership and permissions of files or directories  recursively
Changing file permissions is very tedious. Often times I run into issues when using
code generators to create an application or set of files, wherein the app has only root
permissions and my code formatters can't run against them.

For example, when using [Pre-Commit]() I ran into a `Permission Denied` error for
files that were owned by the `user:group` `root:root`. These were project files that
were generated by Django when running a `startapp <name>` command.

To resolve the issue, I usually want to set everything to `664` for files and `775`
for directories.

Doing this individually with a `chwon <user name:group name> <file/name.txt>`
or `chmod 664 <file/name.txt>` is annoying.

## Recursively changing file/directory permissions
To do this action recursively, we can execute the below:

Example with file permissions:
```bash
# files
find <some/file/path> -type f -exec chmod 664 {}\;

# directories
find <some/directory> -type d -exec chmod 775 {}\;
```

Example with ownership:
```bash
# files
find subscriptions/ -type f -exec chown <user name:group name> {}\;

# directories
find subscriptions/ -type d -exec chown <user name:group name> {}\;
```
